We investigate persistent currents in metallic rings interrupted by a Coulomb-blockaded topological superconducting segment. We show that the presence of Majorana bound states in the superconductor is reflected in the emergence of an h/e harmonic in the persistent current. The Majorana bound states further render the current finite at zero flux, with a sign that is determined by the fermion parity of the superconductor. The resulting peculiar symmetry of the persistent current is compatible with a free energy that is even in time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields. These unique features of the persistent currents are robust against disorder and provide unambiguous signatures of the presence of Majorana fermions.
