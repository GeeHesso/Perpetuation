# Network Inference using Sinusoidal
Probing 

Dated : Feb. 2020 

The aim of this manuscript is to present a non-invasive method to recover the
network structure of a dynamical system. We propose to use a controlled probing input and to
measure the response of the network, in the spirit of what is done to determine oscillation modes
in large electrical networks. For a large class of dynamical systems, we show that this approach
is analytically tractable and we confirm our findings by numerical simulations of networks of
Kuramoto oscillators. Our approach also allows us to determine the number of agents in the
network by probing and measuring a single one of them.
