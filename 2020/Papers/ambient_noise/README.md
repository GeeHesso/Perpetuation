# Network Reconstruction with Ambient Noise 

Dated : July 2020 

The dynamics of systems of coupled agents is determined by the structure of their coupling network. Often, the latter is not directly observable and a fundamental, open question is how to reconstruct it from system measurements. We develop a novel approach to identify the network structure underlying dynamical systems of coupled agents based on their response to homogeneous, ambient noise. We show that two-point frequency signal correlators contain all the information on the network Laplacian matrix. Accordingly, when all agents are observable, the full Laplacian matrix can be reconstructed. Furthermore, when only a fraction of the agents can be observed, pairs of observable agents can be ranked in order of their geodesic distance when the noise correlation time is short enough. The method is computationally light and we show numerically that it is accurate and scalable to large networks.
