Most European countries are now engaged in the energy transition whose ultimate goal is to meet energy demand
from human activities solely with renewable sources. In its current intermediate stages, the transition steadily
increases the penetration of nondispatchable electricity productions, which results in large uncontrolled fluctuations
in power generation. Enforcing the balance between power demand and production under these circumstances
becomes a challenge, which requires increased capacities of flexible, freely dispatchable power productions as well
as storage solutions. Dam hydroelectric power plants are expected to play an important role in the energy transition.
In the context of the liberalized pan-European electricity market, low carbon taxes, decreasing coal prices as well as
subsidies for new renewables have however brought electricity prices down and eroded profit margins so much that
new investments in the hydroelectric sector are all but frozen in alpine countries. It is therefore of utmost importance
to investigate the future of the hydroelectric sector as the energy transition progresses.
