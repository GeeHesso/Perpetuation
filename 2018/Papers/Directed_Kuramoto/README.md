Many real-world systems of coupled agents exhibit directed interactions, meaning that the influence of an agent on another is not reciprocal. Furthermore, interactions usually do not have identical amplitude and/or sign. To describe synchronization phenomena in such systems, we use a generalized Kuramoto model with directed, weighted and signed interactions. Taking a bottom-up approach, we investigate the simplest possible directed networks, namely acyclic directed networks and directed cycles. These two types of networks are fundamental building blocks from which many general directed networks can be constructed. For acyclic, weighted and signed networks, we are able to completely characterize synchronization properties through necessary and sufficient conditions, which we show are optimal. Additionally, we prove that if it exists, a stable synchronous state is unique. In directed, weighted and signed cycles with identical natural frequencies, we show that the system globally synchronizes and that the number of stable synchronous states is finite.
