# Swissgrid’s strategic grid 2025 : an independent analysis

Dated : January 2018

Technical Report

In this report we perform an independent analysis of Swissgrid’s strategic grid 2025. We study the reliability of
the Swiss power system for different scenarios with high penetrations of renewable energy sources (RES) in Swiss
and European energy mixes, corresponding to the year 2030 as currently anticipated. Our investigations show that
the Swiss transmission network will be considerably less congested after the enhancement of the grid from its present
configuration to the strategic grid 2025. We conclude that the latter seems to be appropriately calibrated.
