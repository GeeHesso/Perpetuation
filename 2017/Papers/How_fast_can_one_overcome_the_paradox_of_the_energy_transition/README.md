# How fast can one overcome the paradox of the energy transition? A predictive physico-economic model for the European power grid

[Energy (pending)]

The paradox of the energy transition is that, because of the low marginal costs of new renewable energy sources (RES),
it drags electricity prices down and discourages investments in flexible productions that are needed to compensate for
the lack of dispatchability of the new RES – the energy transition discourages the investments that are required for its
own harmonious expansion. To investigate how this paradox can be overcome, we argue that future electricity prices can
be accurately modeled from the residual load obtained by subtracting the sum of inflexible productions from the load.
Armed with the resulting quantitative economic indicator, we investigate future revenues for power plants with various
degree of flexibility under different scenarios for the energy transition in the European power grid. We find that flexible
productions will be financially rewarded better and sooner if the energy transition proceeds faster but at more or less
constant total production, i.e. by reducing the production of thermal power plants at the same rate as the production
of RES increases. Less flexible productions, on the other hand, will see their revenue grow more moderately. Our results
advocate for a faster energy transition with a quicker withdrawal of baseload thermal power plants.
