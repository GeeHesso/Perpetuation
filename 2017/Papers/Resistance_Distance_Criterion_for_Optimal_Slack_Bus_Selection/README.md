We investigate the dependence of transmission losses on the choice of a slack bus
in high voltage AC transmission networks.
We formulate a transmission loss minimization problem in terms of slack variables 
representing the additional power injection that each generator provides to compensate 
the transmission losses.
We show analytically that for transmission lines having small, homogeneous resistance over reactance ratios r/x<<1, 
transmission losses are generically minimal in the case of a unique *slack bus* instead of a distributed slack bus.
For the unique slack bus scenario, to lowest order in r/x, transmission losses depend linearly on a resistance 
distance based indicator measuring the separation of the slack bus candidate from the rest of the network.
We confirm these results numerically for several IEEE and Pegase testcases, and show that our predictions 
qualitatively hold also in the case of lines having inhomogeneous r/x ratios, 
with optimal slack bus choices reducing transmission losses by 10% typically.
