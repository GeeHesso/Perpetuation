# Robustness of elections results against external influence 

Dated : November 7, 2019

Assessing the robustness of a steady state of a dynamical opinion model is equivalent to identifying the most efficient perturbation strategy. We compare here three strategies of influence on the Taylor model of opinion dynamics in a polarized society. We observe that the final opinion is the most robust when agents only interact with other agents with similar opinions.
