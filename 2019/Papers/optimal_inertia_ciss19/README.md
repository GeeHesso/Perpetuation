# Optimal placement of inertia and primary control in high voltage power grids
Dated : March 2019


The energy transition's ultimate goal is to meet energy demand
 from human activities sustainably. Accordingly, the penetration
 of new renewable energy sources (RES) such as photovoltaic 
 panels and wind turbines is increasing in most power grids.
 In their current configuration, RES are essentially inertialess,
 therefore, low inertia situations are more and more common,
  in periods of high RES production, making grid stability
 a high concern in power grids with high share of RES. It has been
 suggested that the resulting reduction of overall inertia can be
 compensated to some extent by the deployment of substitution inertia
 -- synthetic inertia, flywheels, synchronous condensers aso. 
 Of particular importance is to optimize the placement of the limited
 available substitution inertia. Here, we construct a matrix perturbation
 theory to optimize inertia and primary control placement under the
  assumption that both are moderately heterogeneous. Armed with that
  efficient tool, we construct simple but efficient algorithms that
 independently determine the optimal geographical distribution of
  inertia and primary control.
