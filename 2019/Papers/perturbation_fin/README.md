Optimal placement of inertia and primary control : a matrix perturbation theory approach

Dated : 17.06.2019

The increasing penetration of inertialess new renewable energy sources reduces the overall mechanical inertia available in power grids and accordingly raises a number of issues of  grid stability over short to medium time scales. It has been suggested that this reduction of overall inertia can be compensated to some extent by the deployment of substitution inertia - synthetic inertia, flywheels or synchronous condensers. Of particular importance is to optimize the placement of the limited available substitution inertia, to mitigate voltage angle and frequency disturbances following a fault such as an abrupt power loss. Performance measures in the form of ${\cal H}_2-$norms have been recently introduced to evaluate the overall magnitude of such disturbances on an electric power grid. However, despite the mathematical conveniance of these measures, analytical results can be obtained only under rather restrictive assumptions of uniform damping ratio, or homogeneous distribution of inertia and/or primary control in the 
system. Here, we introduce matrix perturbation theory  to obtain analytical results for optimal inertia and primary control placement where both are heterogeneous. Armed with that efficient tool, we construct two simple algorithms that independently determine the optimal geographical 
distribution of inertia and primary control. These algorithms are then implemented on a model of the synchronous transmission grid of continental Europe. We find that the optimal distribution of inertia is geographically homogeneous but that primary control should be mainly located on the slow modes of the network, where the intrinsic grid dynamics takes more time to damp frequency disturbances.
